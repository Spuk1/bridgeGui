**Description**

This is a simple Gui to create bridge interfaces in order to bridge your network interface to your virtual machine.


**Todo**
Workaround for wireless interfaces as they do not allow to be enslaved to a bridge.


**Usage**

Open a terminal and type:
`python <Path/to/file/>bridgeGui`
or launch it with your window manager.


**Note**
This progam needs administrator rights and will ask you to type in a password.
It will create a group "netAdmin" in order to manage ip interfaces.
Use with caution.
